### Read me! 

Hi there! So you've made it to the Android workshop, this is the perfect place to start. 

This repo is structured so that there is several application packages, `template`, `1`, `2`, and `3`. 

We will start at `template` and build up from that. If at any point you feel like you fell behind and would just like to be up to speed, feel free to just jump to a checkpoint.

The images used in the tutorial app are included in the folder, but feel free to use your own image assets!
